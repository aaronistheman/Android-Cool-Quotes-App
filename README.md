# Android-Cool-Quotes-App

About
-----

With this trivial app that was programmed in Java with the help of Android Studio,
the user can summon the potentially useful words of someone (e.g. the rapper E-40).
I programmed it during the late December of 2015, during my freshman
year in college.

A demonstrative YouTube video can be found here:

Features
--------

The user can switch between four sound effects. Originally, I had seven
sound effects planned, but three of them have explicit language, so
only four are included in the Git repository.

Because there were no helpful places for unit tests in this app,
I wrote none.

Releases
--------

Latest: v0.1

Please see the releases section of this project's Git repository
on GitHub for latest release.

How to Run App
--------------

In Android Studio, run 'app' (i.e. click Run | Run 'app').
